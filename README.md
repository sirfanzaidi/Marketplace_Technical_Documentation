5. Collaborate and Refine

# DAY 3 - API INTEGRATION AND DATA MIGRATION
The focus for Day 3 of the hackathon was on API Integration and Data Migration. The 
task was to integrate external APIs into the marketplace project.I implemented a 
solution that allows us to migrate and import data from an external API into sanity 
CMS. By the end of the day, the objective was to have a fully integrated marketplace 
with dynamic data fetched from APIs and correctly displayed on the frontend.

# DAY 4 - BUILDING DYNAMIC FRONTEND COMPONENTS FOR YOUR MARKETPLACE
On Day 4, the focus was on building dynamic frontend components for an ecommerce marketplace. These components aim to provide a seamless user 
experience, ensuring that customers can easily interact with the website. The goal was 
to design and implement reusable, responsive, and modular components that can 
dynamically display product data fetched from Sanity CMS. By doing so, users can 
easily interact with the website. The project implements the following functionalities :
1. Product Listing Page
2. Product Detail Component
3. Category Component
4. Search Bar
5. Cart Component
6. Wish list Component
7. Checkout Flow Component
8. User Profile Component
9. Pagination Component
10. Footer and Header Components
11. Reviews and Ratings Component

# DAY 5 - TESTING, ERROR HANDLING, AND BACKEND INTEGRATION REFINEMENT
The main goal of DAY-5 was to prepare the marketplace for real-world 
deployment by thoroughly testing all components, identifying and resolving 
errors, optimizing performance, and refining backend integrations. This 
involved performing functional testing to ensure core features like product 
listings, search, and cart operations worked as expected, implementing 
error handling to display user-friendly messages and fallback UI for API 
failures, optimizing performance by reducing load times and compressing 
images, and conducting cross-browser and device testing to ensure 
consistent user experience. Additionally, security testing was conducted to 
validate inputs and secure API communication.


# DAY 6 - DEPLOYMENT PREPARATION AND STAGING ENVIRONMENT SETUP
On Day 6, the focus was on preparing the marketplace for deployment by setting 
up a staging environment, configuring the hosting platforms, and ensuring the 
applicationâ€™s readiness for real-world use. This day was critical to simulate the 
production environment and to catch any potential issues before deploying the 
application to a live, customer-facing environment. The goal was to test the 
application in a production-like setting, which helps to identify any deployment 
or configuration issues that might arise during the final deployment to 
production.
